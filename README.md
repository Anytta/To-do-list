This is an interactive web application written in Java as a Maven project, using JSP and Bootstrap; based on MVC design pattern. 
It allows user to log in and then create his own to-do list entering tasks with name and category. The tasks are displayed in a table and can be deleted or moved to "Completed" list. It also allows to delete tasks from completed list and log out.

In this project the JUnit testing is not yet implemented.
There is no use of database for now.
The password and it's validation should be made more secure (https protocol).

For learning pourposes there is only one user set up and there is no support for Polish alphabet. 

The login page view and list of tasks view are shown below:
